Sweden’s economy has, in many ways, suffered from the same tribulations as the rest of Europe: recent bouts of crushing inflation and recession, and now the prospect of meager growth in a world split by geopolitical and economic conflict.

Nevertheless, the Nordic country has a roster of high-tech entrepreneurs that is the envy of its neighbors. Spotify and Skype are globally recognized brand names. Klarna, a financial tech firm, and King Digital Entertainment, the maker of the video game juggernaut Candy Crush, are other examples of homegrown tech powerhouses.

“They have something — particularly in the tech sector — which other European countries do not really have to the same extent,” said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund.

The United States has turned out a generation of companies like Google, Meta and Amazon, while China’s tech scene flourished with firms like Alibaba, Huawei and ByteDance, the owner of TikTok. Europe, by contrast, has lagged behind, with a few notable exceptions like Spotify and the Dutch semiconductor company ASML.
